name: i-pi
description: A universal force engine interface that can be used to sample thermodynamic ensembles once it is coupled with a function for calculating the energies and forces  
executible: i-pi

tests: 
   positions: yes
   timestep: no
   mass: no
   charge: no

   virial: yes
   energy: yes
   engforces: yes
warning: [
  "You can run multiple systems with different timesteps that all use the same PLUMED driver with i-Pi. The timestep is thus not passed from i-Pi to PLUMED. The time column in any output file generated by PLUMED when it is running with i-Pi does not tell you how much time has elapsed since the start of the calculation."
