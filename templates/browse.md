The codes listed below below were tested on __{thedate}__.
PLUMED-TESTCENTER tested whether the current and development versions of the code can be used to complete the tests for each of these codes.

* If the basic tests are passed then the tested code is able to pass positions to PLUMED and to retrieve forces from PLUMED.  
* If the virial tests are passed then PLUMED handles the virial correctly and you can thus run NPT simulations using PLUMED and the MD code. This feature is not available in some MD codes.  
* If the energy tests are passed the potential energy is correctly passed from the MD code to PLUMED and you can apply forces upon the energy in PLUMED. This feature is also only available in a subset of the supported MD codes.
